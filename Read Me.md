## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

This is an app that allows you and friends to join and play pick the spread in multiple leagues. This app helps you to keep track of your picks, and make sure that you have made all of your selections for a given week.

Here's why:

- There are a lot of games to keep track of each week. If you are keeping track on paper it can be easy to overlook a pick or try to come back later.
- This app will help you to see which picks you have made and which ones you have yet to make a decision on.
- The app will also calculate the winners of each game, calculate which player made the most correct picks for the week and the season.
- You can join more than one league. Perhaps you want to play with co-workers and friends separately. You can do that here.

With a minimalist design this app lets you make your picks with confidence. Just set it and forget it.
